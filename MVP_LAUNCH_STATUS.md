# Common Elements Platform - MVP Launch Status Report
**Generated**: October 26, 2025
**Status**: OPERATIONAL (with known limitations)

## üü¢ COMPLETED & WORKING

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Local Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3002
- ‚úÖ **Production Deployment**: Live at https://common-elements-platform.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ **Database Connection**: Supabase connected (project: dznddcseczfidqxuagul)
- ‚úÖ **Health Endpoint**: `/api/health` returns healthy status
- ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: All required keys configured in production
- ‚úÖ **Build System**: Turborepo monorepo building successfully

### Frontend Features
- ‚úÖ **Landing Page**: Full-featured homepage with:
  - Navigation bar (login/signup buttons)
  - Hero section with CTAs
  - Feature cards (Forum, RFP Management, Vendor Directory)
  - Call-to-action section
  - Footer with links
- ‚úÖ **Login Page**: Form rendering correctly
- ‚úÖ **Signup Page**: Form rendering correctly
- ‚úÖ **Route Protection**: Middleware redirects unauthenticated users to login
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS working

### Technical Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ **Fixed Build Failures**:
  - Moved analytics.ts and monitoring.ts to src/lib/ directory
  - Removed Sentry dependencies (not installed)
  - Stubbed monitoring functions
  - Fixed ESLint configuration for ESLint 9
  - Added build scripts to config packages

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Production Deployment**:
  - Resolved duplicate app directories issue
  - Fixed 404 homepage error
  - Removed obsolete Sentry config files
  - Installed critters for CSS optimization
  - Fixed Next.js Link usage in error.tsx

- ‚úÖ **Fixed Database Issues**:
  - Applied RLS policy fix for user_roles table (no more infinite recursion)
  - Updated health check to use `posts` table instead of problematic `users` table
  - Fixed signup action to work with on_auth_user_created trigger

## üü° KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### Critical Issues (Blocking Signup)
1. **Schema Mismatch**: Production database schema differs from local migrations
   - Users table has `first_name`/`last_name` instead of `full_name`
   - Missing `account_type` column
   - Profile tables differ (board_member_profiles, manager_profiles, etc vs community_profiles)
   - Migration history out of sync

2. **Signup Flow**: Currently failing with "Database error saving new user"
   - Auth user is created in Supabase Auth
   - Database trigger attempts to create user record but may be hitting RLS issues
   - Needs investigation of on_auth_user_created trigger implementation

### Medium Priority
3. **Onboarding Check Disabled**: Middleware onboarding check temporarily commented out
   - Prevents checking if user completed profile setup
   - Users may access protected routes without complete profiles

4. **Analytics Disabled**: Google Analytics integration temporarily disabled
   - Script component API changed in Next.js 15/React 19
   - Needs update to new implementation

5. **Vercel Protection**: Production deployment has authentication protection enabled
   - Main URL redirects to Vercel SSO
   - Need bypass token for automated testing

## üîß RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (Pre-Launch)
1. **Fix Signup Flow**:
   - Investigate on_auth_user_created trigger
   - Verify RLS policies on users table allow INSERT
   - Test with service role key
   - Consider removing trigger and handling manually

2. **Schema Alignment**:
   - Pull actual production schema using `supabase db pull`
   - Update local migrations to match production
   - Or apply local migrations to production (risky)

3. **Enable Onboarding**:
   - Once signup works, re-enable onboarding check
   - Update to use correct profile table names

### Post-Launch Improvements
4. **Re-enable Analytics**: Update Script component usage for React 19
5. **Add Sentry**: Install @sentry/nextjs for error monitoring
6. **Migration Sync**: Establish single source of truth for database schema
7. **Add Tests**: E2E tests for critical flows

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MVP LAUNCH READINESS: 60%

**Can Launch For**:
