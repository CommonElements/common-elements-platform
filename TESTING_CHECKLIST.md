2. Test on real mobile devices, not just browser DevTools
3. Test file uploads with various file types and sizes
4. Test with slow network connection (throttling)
5. Test RLS policies by attempting unauthorized access
6. Verify email notifications work (when implemented)
7. Load test with multiple concurrent users
